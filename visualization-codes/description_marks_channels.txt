Description of Visualizations:
1. Number of Facilities per 100k Across the US (Interactive)
  Marks: 
  - Areas: The states on the choropleth map are represented as polygons (geographic areas).
  - Points: Blue tooltips represent state-level specific data points (like facility types in a particular region).
  
  Channels:
  - Color: The intensity of the color (e.g., shades of blue) represents the Facilities per 100k value, with darker colors indicating higher 
    values and lighter colors indicating lower values.
  - Position: The geographic position (latitude and longitude) maps the data to the specific location of states on the map.
  - Area: The size of the polygons (state areas) reflects their geographic size, though it doesn't directly encode Facilities per 100k.
  - Tooltip (Interactive): State-level details like name, population, and exact Facilities per 100k values are accessible via interaction.
  
  Tasks:
  - Comparison: Compare the Facilities per 100k ratio across states using the color intensity.
  - Exploration: Interact with the map to explore detailed information for individual states, such as population and facility counts.
  - Trend Analysis: Detect geographic trends or patterns in mental health facility distribution across regions (e.g., high-access rural states 
    vs. low-access urban states).
This map highlights significant disparities in mental health facility distribution across the United States, focusing on facilities
per 100,000 people rather than raw counts. States with large populations, like California and Texas, exhibit low facilities-per-100k ratios
(2.45 and 1.25, respectively) despite having high total facility counts, while smaller, less populated states such as Maine (13.73) and 
Vermont (9.33) have higher ratios. The interactive features of the map provide detailed insights into state-level population-adjusted 
facility counts and allow users to explore facility type distributions through horizontal bar charts. Common facility types, such 
as Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and Community-Based Mental Health Centers, dominate across most states, whereas categories like 
Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC) are less prevalent. This analysis underscores how urbanized states may face lower 
per-capita access despite higher total facilities, while less populated states often enjoy better per-capita access. Policymakers 
can leverage these findings to address gaps in underserved regions, particularly in states like Texas and Florida, which have low 
facilities-per-100k ratios, and to improve resource allocation where mental health services are most needed.

    
2. Facility Types by Region 
  Marks:
  - Area: Stacked bar segments represent the values for different facility types within each region.

  Channels:
  - Position: The vertical position of the bars encodes the total and relative contribution of facility types. The horizontal position 
    shows the region 
  - Color: Each facility type is assigned a unique color, allowing viewers to distinguish between them.
  - Size: The area/height (length) of each bar segment shows the magnitude of that facility type's contribution.
  - Text: The numeric values displayed as text on each bar segment provide exact counts (e.g., 0.2, 2.5).

  Tasks:
  - Comparison: Compare the total facilities per 100,000 people across regions. Compare facility type distributions (e.g., dominance of   
    Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities).
  - Trend Analysis: Observe regional patterns in facility availability.

This bar chart provides a regional comparison of mental health facility distribution across the United States, highlighting notable disparities
in facilities per 100,000 people. The Northeast leads with the highest facilities-per-capita ratio, driven by Outpatient/Day Treatment 
Facilities and Community-Based Mental Health Centers, while the Midwest follows with a balanced distribution dominated by the same facility 
types. The West shows fewer facilities per capita, with Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities making up the largest share, and the South has 
the lowest facilities-per-capita ratio, with minimal contributions from most facility types. Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities emerge as 
the dominant facility type across all regions, underscoring their critical role in mental health service delivery. Regional specialization 
is also evident, with the Northeast having a relatively higher proportion of Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities and Multi-setting Mental Health 
Facilities, and the Midwest emphasizing Community-Based Mental Health Centers. However, Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC) remain 
a consistently small proportion in all regions, suggesting limited availability. The South’s low facilities-per-capita ratio across categories
raises equity concerns, pointing to potential disparities in mental health service availability that require targeted intervention.


3. Therapy Services vs Facility Types
  Marks:
  - Lines: Each facility type is represented by a distinct line connecting the axes of the radar chart.
  The lines represent the relative values (percentages) of therapy services offered by each facility type.
  
  Channels:
  - Position: The position of points along each axis represents the percentage of facilities offering a specific therapy service (e.g., 
    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Telemedicine). The radial position (distance from the center) encodes the percentage value.
  - Color: Each facility type is distinguished by a unique color, allowing viewers to easily identify and compare them.
  - Length: The length of the line segments (from the center outward) represents the magnitude (percentage) for each axis.
  - Connection: Lines connect data points for a single facility type, helping to visualize the "profile" of therapy services for that type.
  - Text:Percentages along the axes are textual channel
  
  Tasks:
  - Comparison: Compare therapy service offerings between different facility types (e.g., which facility type offers Cognitive Behavioral 
    Therapy the most?).
  - Distribution Analysis: Analyze how therapy services are distributed across facility types and how certain services (e.g., Telemedicine) vary 
    in availability.

This radar chart highlights the availability of various therapy services across different facility types, showcasing notable trends and
disparities. Telemedicine is predominantly available at Veterans Administration facilities, reflecting their commitment to remote access for
veterans who often reside offsite. Language services are most prevalent in inpatient facilities and community-based centers, emphasizing 
inclusivity, while residential facilities lag significantly in this area, suggesting limited accessibility for non-English-speaking 
individuals. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Group Therapy stand out as foundational services, widely offered across all facility types, as
indicated by their proximity to the chart's outer edge. Trauma therapy, though broadly available, is notably underprovided in residential and
inpatient facilities, raising concerns given the potential need for trauma-informed care in these settings. Activity therapy is most prevalent
in residential and inpatient facilities, aligning with their focus on structured, long-term care, while other facility types offer this service
far less frequently. Overall, the chart underscores the widespread availability of core therapies, such as cognitive behavioral and group 
therapies, while identifying significant service gaps in telemedicine, trauma therapy, and language services, particularly in residential 
facilities. These findings point to opportunities for improving therapy service accessibility and diversity across specific facility types.


4. Treatment Services Offered Trend (2016-2020)
  Marks: lines (trend of each service); points (emphasize data for specific years on each line)
  Channels: color (for each service); line marks (for number of facilities) with aligned vertical position; horizontal position with year
  Tasks: Understanding how the number of facilities offering specific treatments has changed over the years and comparing growth patterns across different treatment categories.

5. Sankey (Interactive)
  Marks: 
  - Nodes: Represent distinct categories or variables in the flow (e.g., "Private nonprofit," "Substance Abuse Treatment: Yes,").
  - Links: Represent flows or connections between nodes, visualized as curved or straight bands.
  - Widths: The thickness of the links encodes the magnitude of the flow between two connected nodes.

  Channels: 
  - Position: Nodes are aligned vertically, with flows between them spanning horizontally.
  - Size: The width of the links encodes the quantity or magnitude of the flow.
  - Labels: Text annotations provide context for nodes and link values, making the diagram readable and informative.
  - Tooltip (Interactive): Displays detailed information (e.g., source, target, magnitude, and percentage of flow) when hovering over a link.

  Tasks: 
  - Flow Analysis: Trace how ownership types are connected to treatment offerings and how they further relate to payment assistance and facility types.
  - Comparison: Compare the magnitude of flows between different nodes to identify dominant connections (e.g., "Substance Abuse Treatment: Yes" has a stronger flow to "Private nonprofit" than to other ownership types).

This Sankey diagram gives us a clear picture of how facilities are distributed in terms of ownership, treatment offerings, payment 
assistance, and facility types. It’s encouraging to see that most facilities offer substance abuse treatment and a large number also 
provide treatment at no charge. However, the bigger picture reveals that while these numbers seem positive, they’re not enough. The flows 
show significant gaps in accessibility and support, especially when we consider the broader demand for mental health and substance abuse 
services. Hovering over each link further enhances the analysis by providing detailed information on each flow, such as the exact magnitude 
and percentage of connections between nodes, allowing for a deeper understanding of specific relationships and disparities in the system. 
Even with nonprofit and public agencies taking on a significant role, many people still struggle to access affordable care in their 
communities. This diagram highlights how the system works—but also how much more needs to be done to close the gaps and ensure everyone who 
needs help can actually get it.
