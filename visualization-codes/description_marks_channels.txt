Description of Visualizations:
1. Number of Facilities per 100k Across the US (Interactive)
  Marks: 
  - Areas: The states on the choropleth map are represented as polygons (geographic areas).
  - Points: Blue tooltips represent state-level specific data points (like facility types in a particular region).
  
  Channels:
  - Color: The intensity of the color (e.g., shades of blue) represents the Facilities per 100k value, with darker colors indicating higher 
    values and lighter colors indicating lower values.
  - Position: The geographic position (latitude and longitude) maps the data to the specific location of states on the map.
  - Area: The size of the polygons (state areas) reflects their geographic size, though it doesn't directly encode Facilities per 100k.
  - Tooltip (Interactive): State-level details like name, population, and exact Facilities per 100k values are accessible via interaction.
  
  Tasks:
  - Comparison: Compare the Facilities per 100k ratio across states using the color intensity.
  - Exploration: Interact with the map to explore detailed information for individual states, such as population and facility counts.
  - Trend Analysis: Detect geographic trends or patterns in mental health facility distribution across regions (e.g., high-access rural states 
    vs. low-access urban states).
  
  
    
2. Facility Types by Region 
  Marks:
  - Area: Stacked bar segments represent the values for different facility types within each region.

  Channels:
  - Position: The vertical position of the bars encodes the total and relative contribution of facility types. The horizontal position 
    shows the region 
  - Color: Each facility type is assigned a unique color, allowing viewers to distinguish between them.
  - Size: The area/height (length) of each bar segment shows the magnitude of that facility type's contribution.
  - Text: The numeric values displayed as text on each bar segment provide exact counts (e.g., 0.2, 2.5).

  Tasks:
  - Comparison: Compare the total facilities per 100,000 people across regions. Compare facility type distributions (e.g., dominance of   
    Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities).
  - Trend Analysis: Observe regional patterns in facility availability.

3. Therapy Services vs Facility Types
  Marks:
  - Lines: Each facility type is represented by a distinct line connecting the axes of the radar chart.
  The lines represent the relative values (percentages) of therapy services offered by each facility type.
  
  Channels:
  - Position: The position of points along each axis represents the percentage of facilities offering a specific therapy service (e.g., 
    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Telemedicine). The radial position (distance from the center) encodes the percentage value.
  - Color: Each facility type is distinguished by a unique color, allowing viewers to easily identify and compare them.
  - Length: The length of the line segments (from the center outward) represents the magnitude (percentage) for each axis.
  - Connection: Lines connect data points for a single facility type, helping to visualize the "profile" of therapy services for that type.
  - Text:Percentages along the axes are textual channel
  
  Tasks:
  - Comparison: Compare therapy service offerings between different facility types (e.g., which facility type offers Cognitive Behavioral 
    Therapy the most?).
  - Distribution Analysis: Analyze how therapy services are distributed across facility types and how certain services (e.g., Telemedicine) vary 
    in availability.



4. Treatment Services Offered Trend (2016-2020)
  Marks: lines (trend of each service); points (emphasize data for specific years on each line)
  Channels: color (for each service); line marks (for number of facilities) with aligned vertical position; horizontal position with year
  Tasks: Understanding how the number of facilities offering specific treatments has changed over the years and comparing growth patterns across different treatment categories.
