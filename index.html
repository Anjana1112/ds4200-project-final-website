        <h3>Introduction to Topic</h3>
        <p> Our project focuses on analyzing mental health service availability 
            and disparities across the United States using data from the National 
            Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS). This topic is critical as 
            mental health care access remains inconsistent across different 
            regions, demographic groups, and facility types, often leaving 
            vulnerable populations underserved. By exploring factors such as 
            geographic location, facility type, patient demographics, and 
            the use of telemedicine, we aim to uncover patterns and disparities 
            in mental health service provision. Understanding these trends is 
            vital for policymakers and health care providers to address gaps in 
            service, improve care equity, and ensure that individuals with mental 
            health needs receive appropriate and timely treatment.

        <p>Monitoring the unemployment rate provides insights into 
            various aspects of the economy, such as consumer spending,
             business confidence, and government policies' effectiveness.
            A high unemployment rate may indicate economic downturns, 
            leading to decreased consumer spending, reduced business 
            investments, and potential social unrest. Conversely, 
            a low unemployment rate signifies a robust economy with 
            ample job opportunities, contributing to higher consumer 
            confidence and economic growth.</p>
        <h3>Introduction to Data</h3>
        <p>Understanding the US unemployment rate is crucial for assessing
            the health of the economy and the well-being of its citizens. 
            The unemployment rate represents the percentage of people in 
            labor force who are actively seeking employment but are unable
            to find jobs. This metric serves as a key indicator of economic
             performance, reflecting the availability of job opportunities 
             and the overall level of economic activity. </p>

                    <p>Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                        has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                        they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single

                        stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                        The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                        of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                        with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                        high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear

                        Given the list of drugs offered at each facility, we grouped them by what they treat. Specifically, we have drugs for 
                        Schizophrenia Treatment,
                        Bipolar Disorder Treatment,
                        Psychotic Disorders (Non-Schizophrenic),
                        Mood Stabilizers (Mania, Depression),
                        Treatment-Resistant or Adjunctive Treatment, and
                        Adjunctive Antidepressants. 
                        From the drug correlation heatmap, we see that even when other drugs are offered, Treatment-Resistant Treatments and Adjunctive Treatments are not typically offered. 
                        This is a huge problem as there are less treatment facilities out there that have the capabilities to support these deographics of people that need this treatment.

                        This problem is made more clear when we break it down to the specific drug, and for each state. 
                        Notice how in every state, the range of facilities that offer the drugs for each treatment types remains the same (in alaska the range for each drug type is about 4-25). 
                        So the reason that the co-occurrence heatmap showed less options for Treatment-Resistant Treatments and 
                        Adjunctive Antidepressant Treatments is that there are simply less treatment options for these categories than the others. 
                        For instance, there are 16 different types of treatment options for bipolar disorder and there are only 4 types of Treatment-Resistant Treatments.
                        Adjunctive Antidepressants and Treatment-Resistant Treatments are typically used for those who do not repond adequately to standard treatment. 
                        For these individuals whose circumstances are already unique, we must continue to research to provide them with more treatment options and alternatives in the future.
