    <h1> Disparities in Mental Health Care Facilities</h1>

    <h3>Introduction to Topic</h3>

    <p>Our project focuses on analyzing mental health service availability 
        and disparities across the United States using data from the National 
        Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS). This topic is critical as 
        mental health care access remains inconsistent across different 
        regions, demographic groups, and facility types, often leaving 
        vulnerable populations underserved. By exploring factors such as 
        geographic location, facility type, patient demographics, and 
        the use of telemedicine, we aim to uncover patterns and disparities 
        in mental health service provision. Understanding these trends is 
        vital for policymakers and health care providers to address gaps in 
        service, improve care equity, and ensure that individuals with mental 
        health needs receive appropriate and timely treatment. </p>

        <h3>Introduction to Data</h3>   
        <p> The data being used is from the National Mental Health Services Survey, which 
            consolidates data from every known mental health treatment facility in the 
            United States from 2010 to 2020. The types of mental health treatment 
            facilities included in the dataset are as follows: psychiatric hospitals, 
            general hospitals, Veterans Affairs medical centers, partial hospitalization/day 
            treatment mental health facilities, outpatient mental health facilities, residential 
            treatment centers for children, residential treatment centers for adults, multi-setting 
            mental health facilities, community mental health centers, non-psychiatric hospitals, and 
            other (any facilities that don’t fall into the previously named categories). 
            The topics included in the survey include facility type, operation, and primary treatment 
            focus, facility treatment characteristics (e.g., settings of care; mental health treatment 
            modalities, pharmacotherapies; supportive services and practices; services provided to 
            clients with co occurring mental health and substance use disorders; dedicated or 
            exclusively designed  programs or groups offered; seclusion or restraint practices; 
            and crisis intervention team  availability), facility operating characteristics 
            (e.g., age groups accepted; availability of treatment services  provided in non-English 
            languages and in sign language for the deaf and hard-of-hearing;  and smoking policy), 
            facility management characteristics (e.g., quality improvement practices; use of electronic 
            resources to accomplish work activities; licensure, certification, and accreditation; 
            sources  of payment and funding), and client characteristics. The data was collected 
            through secure web-based questionnaires, paper questionnaires sent by mail, and 
            computer-assisted telephone interviews. In 2020, 14,187 total eligible facilities were surveyed. 
            The dataset is accessible in formats for SAS, SPSS, Stata, Delimited, and R, and can be 
            downloaded through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) website.

        <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: black;">
            How do differences in facility distribution, therapy offerings, treatment availability, and 
            facility types reflect the current state of access to mental health care in the United States?
        </p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 50px;">Number of Facilities per 100k Across the US</h3>
        
            <div class = 'image'>

            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>This map is designed to show a comprehensive view of mental health facility distribution across the United States, balancing both numbers of facilities per 100,000 people. Here are the key takeaways:</p>

    <p><strong>Map:</strong> The map uses opacity and color intensity to represent the number of facilities per 100,000 people, not just the raw count of facilities. States with high populations, like California (CA) and Texas (TX), may appear lighter in color despite having a high number of facilities because the population size reduces the facilities-per-100k ratio. For instance, California has 970 facilities, but a facilities-per-100k value of 2.45, resulting in a lighter shade. Texas has 363 facilities, but with its large population, the facilities-per-100k ratio is only 1.25, making it even lighter in color.</p>

    <p><strong>High-Intensity States:</strong> States with smaller populations often have higher facilities per capita, leading to darker shades. Examples include Maine (ME) with 187 facilities but a facilities-per-100k ratio of 13.73, and Vermont (VT) with 60 facilities but a facilities-per-100k ratio of 9.33. These states illustrate how small populations can result in a high facilities-per-100k ratio even with fewer absolute facilities.</p>

    <p><strong>Interactive Features:</strong> The map is interactive and allows users to hover over each state to access key details, including State Name, the total population of the state, the number of facilities in the state, and Facilities per 100,000 People (the population-adjusted facility count).</p>

    <p><strong>Facility Types and Bar Charts:</strong> Clicking on a state marker reveals a horizontal bar chart that shows the distribution of facility types in that state. This gives insight into the types of mental health services offered, such as Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities, Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities, and Community-Based Mental Health Centers. States with larger populations, such as California (CA) and New York (NY), show a diverse mix dominated by Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and Residential Treatment Facilities. The most common facility types across states include Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities, Community-Based Mental Health Centers, and Residential Treatment Facilities, while smaller categories like Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC) and Multi-setting Mental Health Facilities are consistently less represented. This data provides critical insights into regional disparities and service availability, underscoring opportunities for targeted resource allocation.</p>

    <p><strong>Insights on Resource Allocation:</strong> This visualization highlights disparities in mental health facility access. Urbanized states may have high total counts but lower availability per capita, while less populated states may have fewer total facilities but higher per-capita access. Policymakers can use this map to identify areas where facilities need to be expanded to address gaps in availability, particularly in states like Texas (TX) and Florida (FL), where the facilities-per-100k values are low relative to their populations.</p>

    <p><strong>Underserved Regions:</strong> States like Texas (TX) (1.25 facilities per 100k) and Florida (FL) (2.29 facilities per 100k) have both high populations and relatively low facilities-per-100k ratios, indicating potential areas for improvement. Other states like Nevada (NV) and South Carolina (SC) also fall into lower tiers of facilities-per-100k.</p>

            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>This stacked bar chart aggregates the data from individual states into regions of the United States, providing a clearer comparison of facility distribution on a regional level.</p>
    <p><strong>Regional Differences in Facilities Per Capita:</strong> The Northeast has the highest overall number of facilities per 100,000 people, with significant contributions from Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and Community-Based Mental Health Centers. The Midwest follows, with a balanced distribution, where Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and Community-Based Mental Health Centers make up the majority. The West has fewer facilities per capita overall, with a large portion attributed to Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities. The South has the lowest number of facilities per capita, with a smaller proportion of Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and fewer contributions from other facility types.</p>
    <p><strong>Dominance of Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities:</strong> Across all regions, Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities are the largest contributors to the total facilities per capita, emphasizing their importance in mental health service delivery.</p>
    <p><strong>Regional Specialization:</strong> The Northeast has a relatively higher proportion of Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities and Multi-setting Mental Health Facilities, indicating a focus on diverse treatment options. The Midwest stands out for its emphasis on Community-Based Mental Health Centers compared to other regions.</p>
    <p><strong>Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC):</strong> These facilities make up a very small proportion across all regions, suggesting either limited availability or lower population-adjusted needs.</p>
    <p><strong>Equity Implications:</strong> The South shows the lowest facilities per capita across almost all categories, potentially reflecting disparities in mental health service availability that might need to be addressed.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 50px;">Therapy Services vs Facility Types</h3>
            <div class = 'image' style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="Radar chart.png" width="70%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
            </div>   
    
                <div class = 'text'>
                    <p>This radar chart compares the availability of various therapy services across different facility types. The key takeaways from this visualization are:</p>
    <p><strong>Telemedicine:</strong> Telemedicine services are highly available at Veterans Administration facilities, which is logical given that many veterans do not reside in these facilities but instead rely on remote access to support when needed. This highlights the facility’s adaptability to meet veterans’ needs through virtual care options.</p>
    <p><strong>Language Services:</strong> Inpatient facilities and community-based centers excel in providing language services, reflecting a strong commitment to inclusivity by offering care in languages other than English. Unfortunately, residential facilities fall significantly behind in this area, suggesting a lack of accessibility for non-English-speaking individuals in long-term care settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Group Therapy:</strong> These therapy types are among the most widely available services across all facility types, with their lines consistently near the outer edge of the chart. This indicates their role as foundational therapeutic approaches in mental health treatment.</p>
    <p><strong>Trauma Therapy:</strong> While trauma therapy is broadly available across most facility types, its provision is notably limited in residential and inpatient facilities. This raises potential concerns, as individuals in these settings may benefit significantly from trauma-informed care.</p>
    <p><strong>Activity Therapy:</strong> Residential and inpatient facilities are leaders in offering activity therapy, with inpatient facilities providing the highest levels. This emphasis aligns with the nature of these settings, where individuals, often residing for extended periods, have greater opportunities to engage in structured activities. In contrast, activity therapy availability in most other facilities is relatively low, often below 15%, except for multi-setting facilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Overall Trends:</strong> The chart underscores the strong presence of core therapies, such as cognitive behavioral and group therapies, across most facility types, while highlighting service gaps in areas like telemedicine, trauma therapy, and language services in specific settings. Residential facilities, in particular, appear to struggle with offering diverse therapy services, especially in language, telemedicine, and trauma therapy.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 50px;">Treatment Services Offered Trend (2016-2020)</h3>
        
            <div class = 'image'>
                <iframe src="treatment_categories_2016_2020.html"  width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Psychotherapy and Behavioral Therapy remained the most commonly offered mental health services,
                    showing growth from 2016 to 2020, with dips in between which may be due to funding issues or shift in focus to other resources. Being offered by the most number of facilities underscores their foundational role 
                    in mental health care, as they are well-understood, evidence-based, and widely accepted by both 
                    patients and healthcare providers.<br></p>
<p>The number of facilities offering Advanced Therapies more than tripled during this period, reflecting a shift toward 
specialized, technology-driven treatment options. This trend may have been driven by advancements in technology, increased
funding for mental health services, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which created urgent
demand for innovative solutions.<br>Dual Therapy and Cognitive Therapy also saw notable growth, likely influenced by the same 
factors, including an expanded focus on integrative and personalized care. <br>Similarly, Trauma and Activity-Based 
Therapies experienced steady growth, signaling a growing recognition of the value of trauma-informed care and non-traditional
interventions in improving mental health outcomes.

            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>This Sankey diagram gives us a clear picture of how facilities are distributed in terms of ownership, treatment offerings, payment 
assistance, and facility types. It’s encouraging to see that most facilities offer substance abuse treatment and a large number also 
provide treatment at no charge. However, the bigger picture reveals that while these numbers seem positive, they’re not enough. The flows 
show significant gaps in accessibility and support, especially when we consider the broader demand for mental health and substance abuse 
services. Hovering over each link further enhances the analysis by providing detailed information on each flow, such as the exact magnitude 
and percentage of connections between nodes, allowing for a deeper understanding of specific relationships and disparities in the system. 
Even with nonprofit and public agencies taking on a significant role, many people still struggle to access affordable care in their 
communities. This diagram highlights how the system works—but also how much more needs to be done to close the gaps and ensure everyone who 
needs help can actually get it. </p>

                    This graph allows you to filter for a state and a drug group and it will show the different treatment options the state offers for each drug type and the number of facilities that offer each treatment option. 
                    Notice how in every state, the range of facilities that offer the drugs for each treatment groups remains the same (in alaska the range for each drug type is about 4-25) and 
                    that there are simply less treatment options for some drug groups than the others. 
                    For instance, there are 16 different types of treatment options for bipolar disorder and there are only 4 types of Treatment-Resistant Treatments.
                    Adjunctive Antidepressants and Treatment-Resistant Treatments are typically used for those who do not repond adequately to standard treatment. 
                    For these individuals whose circumstances are already unique, we must continue to research to provide them with more treatment options and alternatives in the future.
