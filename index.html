        <h1> Mental Health Care Disparities</h1>
        <h3>Introduction to Topic</h3>
        <p> Our project focuses on analyzing mental health service availability 
            and disparities across the United States using data from the National 
            Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS). This topic is critical as 
            mental health care access remains inconsistent across different 
            regions, demographic groups, and facility types, often leaving 
            vulnerable populations underserved. By exploring factors such as 
            geographic location, facility type, patient demographics, and 
            the use of telemedicine, we aim to uncover patterns and disparities 
            in mental health service provision. Understanding these trends is 
            vital for policymakers and health care providers to address gaps in 
            service, improve care equity, and ensure that individuals with mental 
            health needs receive appropriate and timely treatment.

        <h3>References</h3>
        <p>Gao et al. (2024) highlight a global mental health treatment gap, with only 
            42-44% seeking care, especially in low- and middle-income nations. Access is 
            influenced by factors like age, gender, ethnicity, and income, while barriers 
            include cost, transportation, and stigma.
            
Cantor et al. (2024) found that 80% of U.S. mental health facilities offer telehealth, 
            with services varying by facility type and geography. Urban and private 
            hospitals are more likely to provide telehealth, but access is uneven, 
            with median wait times of 14 days.
            
Mirza et al. (2020) explored language barriers in mental health care for patients with 
            limited English proficiency, finding challenges in communication and a lack 
            of qualified interpreters. The study emphasizes the need for tailored 
            training to improve care.
            
These papers inform our research on regional disparities, demographic factors, and 
            the growing role of telemedicine, providing essential context for visualizing inequalities in mental health services. </p>

           <h3>Introduction to Data</h3>   
            <p> The data being used is from the National Mental Health Services Survey, which 
                consolidates data from every known mental health treatment facility in the 
                United States from 2010 to 2020. The types of mental health treatment 
                facilities included in the dataset are as follows: psychiatric hospitals, 
                general hospitals, Veterans Affairs medical centers, partial hospitalization/day 
                treatment mental health facilities, outpatient mental health facilities, residential 
                treatment centers for children, residential treatment centers for adults, multi-setting 
                mental health facilities, community mental health centers, non-psychiatric hospitals, and 
                other (any facilities that donâ€™t fall into the previously named categories). 
                The topics included in the survey include facility type, operation, and primary treatment 
                focus, facility treatment characteristics (e.g., settings of care; mental health treatment 
                modalities, pharmacotherapies; supportive services and practices; services provided to 
                clients with co occurring mental health and substance use disorders; dedicated or 
                exclusively designed  programs or groups offered; seclusion or restraint practices; 
                and crisis intervention team  availability), facility operating characteristics 
                (e.g., age groups accepted; availability of treatment services  provided in non-English 
                languages and in sign language for the deaf and hard-of-hearing;  and smoking policy), 
                facility management characteristics (e.g., quality improvement practices; use of electronic 
                resources to accomplish work activities; licensure, certification, and accreditation; 
                sources  of payment and funding), and client characteristics. The data was collected 
                through secure web-based questionnaires, paper questionnaires sent by mail, and 
                computer-assisted telephone interviews. In 2020, 14,187 total eligible facilities were surveyed. 
                The dataset is accessible in formats for SAS, SPSS, Stata, Delimited, and R, and can be 
                downloaded through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) website.

                    <p>Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty

    <p>This map is designed to show a comprehensive view of mental health facility distribution across the United States, balancing both numbers of facilities per 100,000 people. Here are the key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Map:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The map uses opacity and color intensity to represent the number of facilities per 100,000 people, not just the raw count of facilities.</li>
                <li>States with high populations, like California (CA) and Texas (TX), may appear lighter in color despite having a high number of facilities because the population size reduces the facilities-per-100k ratio:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>For instance:</strong> California has 970 facilities, but a facilities-per-100k value of 2.45, resulting in a lighter shade.</li>
                        <li><strong>Texas:</strong> 363 facilities, but with its large population, the facilities-per-100k ratio is only 1.25, making it even lighter in color.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>High-Intensity States:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>States with smaller populations often have higher facilities per capita, leading to darker shades.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples include:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maine (ME):</strong> 187 facilities, with a facilities-per-100k ratio of 13.73.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vermont (VT):</strong> 60 facilities, with a facilities-per-100k ratio of 9.33.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The map is interactive and allows users to hover over each state to access key details:
                    <ul>
                        <li>State Name</li>
                        <li>Total population of the state</li>
                        <li>Number of facilities in the state</li>
                        <li>Facilities per 100,000 People: The population-adjusted facility count.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Facility Types and Pie Charts:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking on a state marker reveals a pie chart that shows the distribution of facility types in that state.</li>
                <li>This gives insight into the types of mental health services offered, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities</li>
                        <li>Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities</li>
                        <li>Community-Based Mental Health Centers</li>
                        <li>Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC)</li>
                        <li>Multi-setting Mental Health Facilities</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>States with larger populations, such as California (CA) and New York (NY), show a diverse mix dominated by Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and Residential Treatment Facilities. Smaller categories like Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC) and Multi-setting Mental Health Facilities are consistently less represented.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Insights on Resource Allocation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This visualization highlights disparities in mental health facility access:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Urbanized states may have high total counts but lower availability per capita.</li>
                        <li>Less populated states may have fewer total facilities but higher per-capita access.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Policymakers can use this map to identify areas where facilities need to be expanded to address gaps in availability, particularly in states like Texas (TX) and Florida (FL) where the facilities-per-100k values are low relative to their populations.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Underserved Regions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>States like Texas (TX) (1.25 facilities per 100k) and Florida (FL) (2.29 facilities per 100k) have both high populations and relatively low facilities-per-100k ratios, indicating potential areas for improvement.</li>
                <li>Other states like Nevada (NV) and South Carolina (SC) also fall into lower tiers of facilities-per-100k.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
