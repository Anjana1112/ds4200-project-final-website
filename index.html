        <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>
        <p>Understanding the US unemployment rate is crucial for assessing
            the health of the economy and the well-being of its citizens. 
            The unemployment rate represents the percentage of people in 
            labor force who are actively seeking employment but are unable
            to find jobs. This metric serves as a key indicator of economic
             performance, reflecting the availability of job opportunities 
             and the overall level of economic activity. </p>
    
        <p>Monitoring the unemployment rate provides insights into 
            various aspects of the economy, such as consumer spending,
             business confidence, and government policies' effectiveness.
            A high unemployment rate may indicate economic downturns, 
            leading to decreased consumer spending, reduced business 
            investments, and potential social unrest. Conversely, 
            a low unemployment rate signifies a robust economy with 
            ample job opportunities, contributing to higher consumer 
            confidence and economic growth.</p>

                    <p>Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                        has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                        they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single

                        stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                        The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                        of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                        with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                        high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
