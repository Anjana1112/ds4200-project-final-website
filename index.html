        <h1> Mental Health Care Disparities</h1>
        <h3>Introduction to Topic</h3>
        <p> Our project focuses on analyzing mental health service availability 
            and disparities across the United States using data from the National 
            Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS). This topic is critical as 
            mental health care access remains inconsistent across different 
            regions, demographic groups, and facility types, often leaving 
            vulnerable populations underserved. By exploring factors such as 
            geographic location, facility type, patient demographics, and 
            the use of telemedicine, we aim to uncover patterns and disparities 
            in mental health service provision. Understanding these trends is 
            vital for policymakers and health care providers to address gaps in 
            service, improve care equity, and ensure that individuals with mental 
            health needs receive appropriate and timely treatment.

        <h3>References</h3>
        <p>Gao et al. (2024) highlight a global mental health treatment gap, with only 
            42-44% seeking care, especially in low- and middle-income nations. Access is 
            influenced by factors like age, gender, ethnicity, and income, while barriers 
            include cost, transportation, and stigma.
            
Cantor et al. (2024) found that 80% of U.S. mental health facilities offer telehealth, 
            with services varying by facility type and geography. Urban and private 
            hospitals are more likely to provide telehealth, but access is uneven, 
            with median wait times of 14 days.
            
Mirza et al. (2020) explored language barriers in mental health care for patients with 
            limited English proficiency, finding challenges in communication and a lack 
            of qualified interpreters. The study emphasizes the need for tailored 
            training to improve care.
            
These papers inform our research on regional disparities, demographic factors, and 
            the growing role of telemedicine, providing essential context for visualizing inequalities in mental health services. </p>

           <h3>Introduction to Data</h3>   
            <p> The data being used is from the National Mental Health Services Survey, which 
                consolidates data from every known mental health treatment facility in the 
                United States from 2010 to 2020. The types of mental health treatment 
                facilities included in the dataset are as follows: psychiatric hospitals, 
                general hospitals, Veterans Affairs medical centers, partial hospitalization/day 
                treatment mental health facilities, outpatient mental health facilities, residential 
                treatment centers for children, residential treatment centers for adults, multi-setting 
                mental health facilities, community mental health centers, non-psychiatric hospitals, and 
                other (any facilities that donâ€™t fall into the previously named categories). 
                The topics included in the survey include facility type, operation, and primary treatment 
                focus, facility treatment characteristics (e.g., settings of care; mental health treatment 
                modalities, pharmacotherapies; supportive services and practices; services provided to 
                clients with co occurring mental health and substance use disorders; dedicated or 
                exclusively designed  programs or groups offered; seclusion or restraint practices; 
                and crisis intervention team  availability), facility operating characteristics 
                (e.g., age groups accepted; availability of treatment services  provided in non-English 
                languages and in sign language for the deaf and hard-of-hearing;  and smoking policy), 
                facility management characteristics (e.g., quality improvement practices; use of electronic 
                resources to accomplish work activities; licensure, certification, and accreditation; 
                sources  of payment and funding), and client characteristics. The data was collected 
                through secure web-based questionnaires, paper questionnaires sent by mail, and 
                computer-assisted telephone interviews. In 2020, 14,187 total eligible facilities were surveyed. 
                The dataset is accessible in formats for SAS, SPSS, Stata, Delimited, and R, and can be 
                downloaded through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) website.

        <p>This map is designed to show a comprehensive view of mental health facility distribution across the United States, balancing both numbers of facilities per 100,000 people. Here are the key takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Map:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The map uses opacity and color intensity to represent the number of facilities per 100,000 people, not just the raw count of facilities.</li>
                    <li>States with high populations, like California (CA) and Texas (TX), may appear lighter in color despite having a high number of facilities because the population size reduces the facilities-per-100k ratio.
                        <ul>
                            <li>For instance, California has 970 facilities, but a facilities-per-100k value of 2.45, resulting in a lighter shade.</li>
                            <li>Texas has 363 facilities, but with its large population, the facilities-per-100k ratio is only 1.25, making it even lighter in color.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>High-Intensity States:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>States with smaller populations often have higher facilities per capita, leading to darker shades.</li>
                    <li>Examples include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maine (ME): 187 facilities, but with a facilities-per-100k ratio of 13.73.</li>
                            <li>Vermont (VT): 60 facilities, but a facilities-per-100k ratio of 9.33.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>These states illustrate how small populations can result in a high facilities-per-100k ratio even with fewer absolute facilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The map is interactive and allows users to hover over each state to access key details:
                        <ul>
                            <li>State Name</li>
                            <li>The total population of the state.</li>
                            <li>The number of facilities in the state.</li>
                            <li>Facilities per 100,000 People: The population-adjusted facility count.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Facility Types and Pie Charts:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clicking on a state marker reveals a pie chart that shows the distribution of facility types in that state.</li>
                    <li>This gives insight into the types of mental health services offered, such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities</li>
                            <li>Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities</li>
                            <li>Community-Based Mental Health Centers</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>States with larger populations, such as California (CA) and New York (NY) show a diverse mix dominated by Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and Residential Treatment Facilities. The most common facility types across states include Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities, Community-Based Mental Health Centers, and Residential Treatment Facilities, while smaller categories like Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC) and Multi-setting Mental Health Facilities are consistently less represented. This data provides critical insights into regional disparities and service availability, underscoring opportunities for targeted resource allocation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Insights on Resource Allocation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This visualization highlights disparities in mental health facility access:</li>
                    <li>Urbanized states may have high total counts but lower availability per capita.</li>
                    <li>Less populated states may have fewer total facilities but higher per-capita access.</li>
                    <li>Policymakers can use this map to identify areas where facilities need to be expanded to address gaps in availability, particularly in states like Texas (TX) and Florida (FL) where the facilities-per-100k values are low relative to their populations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Underserved Regions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>States like Texas (TX) (1.25 facilities per 100k) and Florida (FL) (2.29 facilities per 100k) have both high populations and relatively low facilities-per-100k ratios, indicating potential areas for improvement.</li>
                    <li>Other states like Nevada (NV) and South Carolina (SC) also fall into lower tiers of facilities-per-100k.</li>

    <p>This stacked bar chart aggregates the data from individual states into regions of the United States, providing a clearer comparison of facility distribution on a regional level.</p>
    <p><strong>Regional Differences in Facilities Per Capita:</strong></p>
    <p>The Northeast has the highest overall number of facilities per 100,000 people, with significant contributions from Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and Community-Based Mental Health Centers.</p>
    <p>The Midwest follows, with a balanced distribution, where Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and Community-Based Mental Health Centers make up the majority.</p>
    <p>The West has fewer facilities per capita overall, with a large portion attributed to Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities.</p>
    <p>The South has the lowest number of facilities per capita, with a smaller proportion of Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities and fewer contributions from other facility types.</p>
    <p><strong>Dominance of Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities:</strong></p>
    <p>Across all regions, Outpatient/Day Treatment Facilities are the largest contributors to the total facilities per capita, emphasizing their importance in mental health service delivery.</p>
    <p><strong>Regional Specialization:</strong></p>
    <p>The Northeast has a relatively higher proportion of Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities and Multi-setting Mental Health Facilities, indicating a focus on diverse treatment options.</p>
    <p>The Midwest stands out for its emphasis on Community-Based Mental Health Centers compared to other regions.</p>
    <p><strong>Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC):</strong></p>
    <p>These facilities make up a very small proportion across all regions, suggesting either limited availability or lower population-adjusted needs.</p>
    <p><strong>Equity Implications:</strong></p>
    <p>The South shows the lowest facilities per capita across almost all categories, potentially reflecting disparities in mental health service availability that might need to be addressed.</p>

    </div>
                
<div class="content" style="text-align: left; max-height: 150px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>This radar chart compares the availability of various therapy services across different facility types. The key takeaways from this visualization are:</p>
    <p><strong>Telemedicine:</strong> Telemedicine services are highly available at Veterans Administration facilities, which is logical given that many veterans do not reside in these facilities but instead rely on remote access to support when needed. This highlights the facilityâ€™s adaptability to meet veteransâ€™ needs through virtual care options.</p>
    <p><strong>Language Services:</strong> Inpatient facilities and community-based centers excel in providing language services, reflecting a strong commitment to inclusivity by offering care in languages other than English. Unfortunately, residential facilities fall significantly behind in this area, suggesting a lack of accessibility for non-English-speaking individuals in long-term care settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Group Therapy:</strong> These therapy types are among the most widely available services across all facility types, with their lines consistently near the outer edge of the chart. This indicates their role as foundational therapeutic approaches in mental health treatment.</p>
    <p><strong>Trauma Therapy:</strong> While trauma therapy is broadly available across most facility types, its provision is notably limited in residential and inpatient facilities. This raises potential concerns, as individuals in these settings may benefit significantly from trauma-informed care.</p>
    <p><strong>Activity Therapy:</strong> Residential and inpatient facilities are leaders in offering activity therapy, with inpatient facilities providing the highest levels. This emphasis aligns with the nature of these settings, where individuals, often residing for extended periods, have greater opportunities to engage in structured activities. In contrast, activity therapy availability in most other facilities is relatively low, often below 15%, except for multi-setting facilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Overall Trends:</strong> The chart underscores the strong presence of core therapies, such as cognitive behavioral and group therapies, across most facility types, while highlighting service gaps in areas like telemedicine, trauma therapy, and language services in specific settings. Residential facilities, in particular, appear to struggle with offering diverse therapy services, especially in language, telemedicine, and trauma therapy.</p>

                    <p>Psychotherapy and Behavioral Therapy remained the most commonly offered mental health services,
                        showing consistent growth from 2016 to 2020. This stability underscores their foundational role 
                        in mental health care, as they are well-understood, evidence-based, and widely accepted by both 
                        patients and healthcare providers.<br></p>
<p>The number of facilities offering Advanced Therapies more than tripled during this period, reflecting a shift toward 
    specialized, technology-driven treatment options. This trend may have been driven by advancements in technology, increased
    funding for mental health services, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted mental health challenges and created urgent
    demand for innovative solutions.<br>Dual Therapy and Cognitive Therapy also saw notable growth, likely influenced by the same 
    factors, including an expanded focus on integrative and personalized care. <br>Similarly, Trauma Therapy and Activity-Based 
    Therapy experienced steady growth, signaling a growing recognition of the value of trauma-informed care and non-traditional
    interventions in improving mental health outcomes. These trends reflect the mental health sector's efforts to address diverse 
    patient needs and explore new therapeutic modalities.

        <p>This Sankey diagram gives us a clear picture of how facilities are distributed in terms of ownership, 
            treatment offerings, payment assistance, and facility types. Itâ€™s encouraging to see that most facilities offer
            substance abuse treatment and a large number also provide treatment at no charge. However, the bigger picture 
            reveals that while these numbers seem positive, theyâ€™re not enough. The flows show significant gaps in accessibility 
            and support, especially when we consider the broader demand for mental health and substance abuse services. Even with 
            nonprofit and public agencies taking on a significant role, many people still struggle to access affordable care in 
            their communities. This diagram highlights how the system worksâ€”but also how much more needs to be done to close the 
            gaps and ensure everyone who needs help can actually get it. </p>

                        Given the list of drugs offered at each facility, we grouped them by what they treat. Specifically, we have drugs for 
                        Schizophrenia Treatment,
                        Bipolar Disorder Treatment,
                        Psychotic Disorders (Non-Schizophrenic),

                        Adjunctive Antidepressants. 
                        From the drug correlation heatmap, we see that even when other drugs are offered, Treatment-Resistant Treatments and Adjunctive Treatments are not typically offered. 
                        This is a huge problem as there are less treatment facilities out there that have the capabilities to support these deographics of people that need this treatment.

                        This problem is made more clear when we break it down to the specific drug, and for each state. 
                        Notice how in every state, the range of facilities that offer the drugs for each treatment types remains the same (in alaska the range for each drug type is about 4-25). 
                        So the reason that the co-occurrence heatmap showed less options for Treatment-Resistant Treatments and 
                        Adjunctive Antidepressant Treatments is that there are simply less treatment options for these categories than the others. 
                        For instance, there are 16 different types of treatment options for bipolar disorder and there are only 4 types of Treatment-Resistant Treatments.
                        Adjunctive Antidepressants and Treatment-Resistant Treatments are typically used for those who do not repond adequately to standard treatment. 
                        For these individuals whose circumstances are already unique, we must continue to research to provide them with more treatment options and alternatives in the future.

                    Conclusion
                </div>  
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The findings from this comprehensive analysis of mental health care facilities across the United States highlight several critical insights into access, distribution, therapy offerings, and treatment availability. The conclusions can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p><b>1. Core Therapies:</b> Psychotherapy, Behavioral Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Group Therapy are widely available, underscoring their foundational role in mental health care.</p>
<p><b>2. Growth in Specialized Treatments:</b> Advanced therapies, trauma-informed care, and activity-based interventions have significantly expanded, reflecting technological advancements and rising demand.</p>
<p><b>3. Facility Distribution Disparities:</b> Larger states like Texas and Florida have low facilities-per-capita ratios, while the Northeast and Midwest lead in accessibility. The South lags behind significantly.</p>
<p><b>4. Service Gaps in Facilities:</b> Residential facilities lack diversity in therapies, particularly trauma therapy, telemedicine, and language services, limiting access for underserved populations.</p>
<p><b>5. Treatment Gaps for Complex Cases:</b> Facilities offering treatment-resistant therapies and adjunctive antidepressants are scarce, leaving critical gaps for those needing specialized care.</p>
<p><b>6. Regional Specialization:</b> The Northeast offers diverse treatment options, the Midwest emphasizes community-based care, while the South and West lack comprehensive services.</p>
<p><b>7. Technology and Accessibility:</b> Telemedicine thrives in VA facilities but needs expansion across all facility types to enhance rural and underserved access.</p>
<p><b>Recommendations</b>
<p><b>*</b> Address regional disparities by expanding facilities in underserved areas.</p>
<p><b>*</b> Invest in specialized treatment options for complex cases.</p>
<p><b>*</b> Diversify services in residential facilities to improve inclusivity.</p>
<p><b>*</b> Expand telemedicine and ensure equitable funding for public and nonprofit facilities.</p>
<p>By addressing these gaps and leveraging the insights gained from this analysis, the United States can work towards a more equitable and comprehensive mental health care system, ensuring that individuals across all states and demographics have access to the care they need.
