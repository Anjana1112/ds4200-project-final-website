        <h1> Mental Health Care Disparities</h1>
        <h3>Introduction to Topic</h3>
        <p> Our project focuses on analyzing mental health service availability 
            and disparities across the United States using data from the National 
            Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS). This topic is critical as 
            mental health care access remains inconsistent across different 
            regions, demographic groups, and facility types, often leaving 
            vulnerable populations underserved. By exploring factors such as 
            geographic location, facility type, patient demographics, and 
            the use of telemedicine, we aim to uncover patterns and disparities 
            in mental health service provision. Understanding these trends is 
            vital for policymakers and health care providers to address gaps in 
            service, improve care equity, and ensure that individuals with mental 
            health needs receive appropriate and timely treatment.

        <h3>References</h3>
        <p>Gao et al. (2024) highlight a global mental health treatment gap, with only 
            42-44% seeking care, especially in low- and middle-income nations. Access is 
            influenced by factors like age, gender, ethnicity, and income, while barriers 
            include cost, transportation, and stigma.
            
Cantor et al. (2024) found that 80% of U.S. mental health facilities offer telehealth, 
            with services varying by facility type and geography. Urban and private 
            hospitals are more likely to provide telehealth, but access is uneven, 
            with median wait times of 14 days.
            
Mirza et al. (2020) explored language barriers in mental health care for patients with 
            limited English proficiency, finding challenges in communication and a lack 
            of qualified interpreters. The study emphasizes the need for tailored 
            training to improve care.
            
These papers inform our research on regional disparities, demographic factors, and 
            the growing role of telemedicine, providing essential context for visualizing inequalities in mental health services. </p>

           <h3>Introduction to Data</h3>   
            <p> The data being used is from the National Mental Health Services Survey, which 
                consolidates data from every known mental health treatment facility in the 
                United States from 2010 to 2020. The types of mental health treatment 
                facilities included in the dataset are as follows: psychiatric hospitals, 
                general hospitals, Veterans Affairs medical centers, partial hospitalization/day 
                treatment mental health facilities, outpatient mental health facilities, residential 
                treatment centers for children, residential treatment centers for adults, multi-setting 
                mental health facilities, community mental health centers, non-psychiatric hospitals, and 
                other (any facilities that donâ€™t fall into the previously named categories). 
                The topics included in the survey include facility type, operation, and primary treatment 
                focus, facility treatment characteristics (e.g., settings of care; mental health treatment 
                modalities, pharmacotherapies; supportive services and practices; services provided to 
                clients with co occurring mental health and substance use disorders; dedicated or 
                exclusively designed  programs or groups offered; seclusion or restraint practices; 
                and crisis intervention team  availability), facility operating characteristics 
                (e.g., age groups accepted; availability of treatment services  provided in non-English 
                languages and in sign language for the deaf and hard-of-hearing;  and smoking policy), 
                facility management characteristics (e.g., quality improvement practices; use of electronic 
                resources to accomplish work activities; licensure, certification, and accreditation; 
                sources  of payment and funding), and client characteristics. The data was collected 
                through secure web-based questionnaires, paper questionnaires sent by mail, and 
                computer-assisted telephone interviews. In 2020, 14,187 total eligible facilities were surveyed. 
                The dataset is accessible in formats for SAS, SPSS, Stata, Delimited, and R, and can be 
                downloaded through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) website.

                    <p>Psychotherapy and Behavioral Therapy remained the most commonly offered services, 
                        with consistent growth across the years. Psychotherapy increased slightly from 2016 
                        to 2020, while Behavioral Therapy peaked in 2019. These services' stability suggests 
                        they are foundational in mental health care, being well-understood and widely accepted 
                        by both patients and healthcare providers.</p>
<p>The number of facilities offering Advanced Therapies more than tripled from 2016 to 2020, suggesting a shift 
                        towards more specialized and innovative technology-driven treatment options, fueled by 
                        technological advancements, and possibly, the pandemic, which highlighted mental health 
                        challenges and led to an expansion in available mental health services, possibly due to 
                        increased funding, innovation, or urgent demand. Dual and Cognitive Therapy saw notable 
                        growth at the same time which may also be attributed to the above reasons.</p>

                    <p>Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                        has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                        they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single 
                        parents is the second important feature which indicates the 
                        stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                        The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                        of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                        with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                        high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
                        relation with the unemployment rate is Metropolitan, which means the
